1.
There is no NP-complete problem that can be solved in O(n^log(n)) time, where n is the size of the input.

2.
If TSP2 is polynomial-time solvable, then so is TSP1.  If HAM2 is polynomial-time solvable, then so is HAM1.

3.
For a griven source s and destination t, compute the length of a shortest s-t path that has exactly n-1 edges (or +inf, if not such path exists).  The path is allowed to contain cycles.

4.
If the minimum-size vertext cover problem can be solved in time O(T(n)) in general graphs, then the maximum-size independent set problem can be solved in O(T(n)) in general graphs.

5.
Consider a TSP instance in which every edge cost is the Euclidean distance....
