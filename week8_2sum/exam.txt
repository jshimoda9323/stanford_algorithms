1.
If P has only 1 edge, then P definitely remains the shortest path
P might or might not remain the shortest path

2.
O(n*m)

3.
O(log(n)) and O(log(n))

4.
might or might not remain the same

5.
Depth first search can be used to compute a topological ordering or a directed acyclic graph in O(m+n) time
Breadth first search can be used to compute the shortest paths in O(m+n) time 
Depth first search can be used to compute the strongly connected components of a directed graph in O(m+n) time

6.
Whenever it is directed acyclic

7.
O(n) and O(1)

8.
Repeated minimum computations
Repeated maximum computations

9.
Repeated lookups

10.
It may or may not correctly compute the shortest path lengths
It is guaranteed to terminate
