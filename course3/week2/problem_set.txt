1.
Both algorithms might fail...

2.
Both algorithms compute a maximum-cost spanning tree of G, but they might computer different ones.

3.
The algorithm always outputs a minimum spanning tree.

4.
A minimum bottleneck spanning tree is not always a minimum spanning tree, but a minimum spanning tree is always a minimum bottleneck spanning tree.

5.
All of them
