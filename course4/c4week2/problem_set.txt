1.
Some NP-complete problems are polynomial-time solvable, and some NP-complete problems are not polynomial-time solvable.

2.
If TSP2 is polynomial-time solvable, then so is TSP1.  If HAM2 is polynomial-time solvable, then so is HAM1.

3.
For a griven source s and destination t, compute the length of a shortest s-t path that has exactly n-1 edges (or +inf, if not such path exists).  The path is allowed to contain cycles.

4.
All three are true.

5.
Consider a TSP instance in which every edge cost is the Euclidean distance....
