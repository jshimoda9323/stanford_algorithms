1.
Only the modification of Kruskal's algorithm always computes a maximum-weight acyclic subgraph.
Correct Answer: Neither.

2.
Both algorithms compute a maximum-cost spanning tree of G, but they might computer different ones.

3.
The algorithm always outputs a minimum spanning tree.

4.
A minimum bottleneck spanning tree is not always a minimum spanning tree, but a minimum spanning tree is always a minimum bottleneck spanning tree.

5.
Yes.  Suppose e E T and we decrease the cost of e.  Then, the new MST can be recomputed in O(m) deterministic time.
Yes.  Suppose e ^E T and we increase the cost of e.  Then, the new MST can be recomputed in O(m) deterministic time.
Correct Answer: all of them
